## Overview

**Background:** Hydrogels are multi-stimuli-responsive actuators in the field of soft robotics. However, application-specific modelling and corresponding experimental validation for this material are currently limited.

In this project, I developed a multi-physics simulation model, coupled with experimental validation, for the electrically induced actuation of NaAc/AAm hydrogel beams immersed in a NaCl solution.





---

## Experiment

I established a repeatable experimental system for fabricating NaAc-AAm hydrogel beams and conducting actuation tests, to test the electro responses of material and validate the corresponding simulation.

### Fabrication

- The hydrogel composition was iterated to achieve controllable polmerisation speed, maximum electro responses.

### Swelling Actuation Test

I conducted swelling actuation tests on the fabricated hydrogel beams in a NaCl bath, with varying crosslinker ratio and salt concentration, also as a way to validate the simulation.




**Results — swelling under different conditions:**
| Crosslinker ratio  or NaCl concentration| 1:200 | 1:2000 | 0.01 M | 0.1 M | 1 M  |
|----------------------------------|-------|--------|--------|-------|------|
| Swollen width (mm)               | 3.00  | 5.00   | 3.00   | 2.55  | 2.05 |
| Swelling ratio (vs. reference)   | 3     | 5      | 3      | 2.55  | 2.05 |

### Bending Actuation Test

I conducted bending actuation tests on the fabricated hydrogel beams in a NaCl bath, under an electric field, with varying crosslinker ratio and electric field strength, as a way to validate the simulation.

- The bending response exhibits first-order–like dynamics, with an initially near-linear transient and an asymptotic approach to its magnitude limit; behaviour against varying parameters (electric field strength, crosslinker ratio) is also used to validate the simulation.

## Simulation (Python + MATLAB)

I built a multi-physics simulation that predicts the actuation of electro-active hydrogel beams in a salt bath under an electric field, which involves formulating and solving a coupled nonlinear, nonconvex constrained optimization system, incorporating physical feasibility constraints and approximated physical conditions.
The prediction is benchmarked against experimental results, literature, and self-consistency checks.
</br>
</br>
The governing physics includes:
- Diffusion-convection equation
- Poisson equation for electric potential
- Continuity equation
- Momentum equation


### Predicted Actuation

  <summary><i>Against different voltages</i></summary>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <ul>
      <li>
        The predicted swelling is within the same order of magnitude as the experimental values.
      </li>
      <li>
        The predicted swelling increases to a maximum of 8.7% in the presence of an electric field, which was not observed in the experiments.
      </li>
      <li>
        The predicted deflection exhibits the same trend as that observed in the experiments.

  <summary><i>Against different reference water percentages ψ₀ʷ</i></summary>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <ul>
      <li>
        The simulation and the experiment exhibited opposite behaviours when the crosslinker ratio was assumed to be associated solely with ψ₀ʷ.
      </li>
      <li>
        Further investigation will include the effect of the crosslinker on the Lamé coefficients.

  <summary><i>Against different salt bath concentrations c*</i></summary>
  <div style="text-align: left;">
    <ul>
      <li>
        The predicted swelling follows the same trend as the experimental result; however, to achieve a linear swelling decrease, the model requires a near-linear increase in salt concentration, whereas the experiment requires an exponential increase.
      </li>
      <li>
        Further investigation will increase the sample size and the parameter range, to realize a more confident analysis.

### Further Validation

- **Dependence of predicted swelling on domain length (expected invariance)** — I used a range of numerical domain lengths to investigate their influence on the predicted swollen width (at ψ₀ʷ = 0.6; NaCl = 10 mol/m³). A 20% change in domain length leads to only 1% variation in predicted swelling width, demonstrating simulation reliability in this regard.

## Limitations

- Only a **limited range** of voltage and electrode distance can be used, to avoid electrolysis and ensure visible bending.
- Due to the **intrinsic accuracy limitation** of the selected local nonlinear solvers, consistent results were only produced within:
  - Voltage: 0.0625 V – 0.1875 V
  - Salt concentration: 8.75 – 11.25 mol/m³
  - Reference water volume percentage: 0.6 – 0.9
- A **parameter misalignment** exists between the experimental and simulation ranges, which partially reduces the credibility of the experimental validation.

---

## Future Work

- Apply **deterministic global nonlinear solvers** and greater computational resources to improve numerical accuracy and consistency.
- Computationally investigate applicable parameter ranges first, then test viable combinations experimentally to close the simulation–experiment gap.
